	Centerline ROAD feature

	**	Road ID
		Street

		Left  Address range
		Right Address ramge

		Left  Address Parity [0 = Even  1 = Odd]

	ESRI ROAD table		[ESRI extract from Road feature]

	**	Road ID		[Centerline record]
		From Node ID	[temporary ESRI value]
		To   Node ID	

	Note:		ESRI Road record generates 4 Spoke records 
			for 2 Node Junctions = From & To

	SPOKE table

	**	Hub Node
	**	Road
	**	Side			[+1 = Left	-1 = Right		Road Side]

		REGION		[of Region Type being considered]


	CORNER table		[Intersection of 2 Spokes]

	**	Node
	**	This Road 

		Side			[Junction * Cross Product]

		That Road
		REGION

	Note:	Cross Product = [This X Vector * That Y Vector ] - [That X Vector * This Y Vector]
		Indicates whether This Road is the clockwise (positive) or counterclockwise (negative) leg
		of the intersecting Spokes (This road & That road)

	Note: Corner Side = Side of This Road containing intersecting region
		Corner Side = Sign(Cross Product) * Junction

		Side		= +1 or -1  =  Left or Right
		Sign(CP)	= +1 or -1  =  Clockwise or CounterClockwise
		Junction	= +1 or -1	=  From or To

	Intersect Key
	Intersect Link

	If Old intersection is not in New Intersection, then intersection Link = negative intersection Key

	Insert New intersection into Old intersection w/ Ora Sequence

	intersect Link = null			intersection is valid
	intersect Link = negative		intersection is unresolved
	intersect Link = positive			points to corrected intersection
	intersect Link = zero (99999)		then intersection does not exist
