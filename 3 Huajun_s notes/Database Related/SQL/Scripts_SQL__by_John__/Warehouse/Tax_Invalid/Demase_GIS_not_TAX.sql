I found myself with some time on my hands so decided to work some more on the Tax addresses.  (I know, I must be REALLY bored.)  
Anyway, the information below is for your records.  There are 22 addresses in GIS with no matching Tax records that I need you guys to research/correct.  
I think all other non-matching records have been accounted for or corrected.  
Just a reminder, I was doing my research using the "project" Sean loaded on my machine several months ago 
so forgive me if some of the changes have already been made in GIS.
