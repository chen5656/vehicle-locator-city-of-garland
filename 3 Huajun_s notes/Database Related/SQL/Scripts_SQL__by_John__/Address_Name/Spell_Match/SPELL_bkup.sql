	Look for complex dipthongs in Poor Name.	poor_ph = sign(instr(poor_name, 'PH'))
	Look for complex dipthongs in Good Name.	good_ph = sign(instr(good_name, 'PH'))
	If imbalanced then make replacements and add weight.
	Example: Replace 'PH' by 'F'  and add weight_complex_dipthong

	Determine the basic error per exact matching and set hard weight.

	Check for soft or hard confirmation.
	If neither then	look ahead for sound-alike (simple dipthong) 
				check for hard confimation	
	Else have a roadblock.

	Reduce weight if basic non-match letters are sound-alike (soft match).

--	======================================================================
/*
	Poor		An invalid name looking for the closest matching valid name(s).
	Good		A valid name that may or may not be a close match to the invalid name.

	Name		A poor or good name.
	Sound		A poor or good name consisting of sound-alike representives.
			Example: 'C' is the sound-alike representative for 'C' 'K' 'Q'

	Score		The final result is a measure of the difference in spelling between the Poor and Good names.
			A bigger score means a bigger difference. The best matches have less than a "best score".

	Errors	The basic errors are Wrong, Missing, Extra, and Transposed letters (see Compare below).
			Transposed letters are adjacent (eg. Wanlut). Transplaced letters are non-adjacent (eg. Jutiper).

	Weight	The weight associated with a spelling error.  
			A weight is reduced if the error occurs for sound-alike letters or dipthongs.
			The score is the sum of the weights.

	Note		Both letters and numbers are referred to here as a "letter" or "alph".
			Punctuation is treated as spcees.

	Slot		A slot includes a letter (Alph), its sound-alike (Sond), whether it is followed by a spcee (spce),
			whether it is doubled (Dupe), and its sequence (Seq) within the word.

	Slots		The mis-matched letters are recorded in P1 (Poor) and G1 (Good) slots.
			The immediately preceding letters are recorded in P0 and G0 slots.
			The next non-blank, non_dupe letters after P1 and G1 are recorded in P2 and G2 slots.
			The next non-blank, non-dupe letters after P2 and G2 are recorded in P3 and G3 slots.

	Compare	Compare P1 and G2 and compare P2 and G1.  Each compare can be true or false as an exact match.
			True and True	indicates Transposed letters
			True and False	indicates Missing letter
			False and True	indicates Extra letter
			False and False	indicates Wrong letter

	Adjust	Each error implies that an adjustment be made for subsequent comparison.
			Example:  Transposed letters in P1,P2/G1,G2 imply that P3,G3 should be compared next.

	Confirm	An Adjustment should give a subsequent comparison of the same or sound-alike letters.
			If not, then a "roadblock" exists and no further progress is possible in the vector direction.

	Vector	Comparison of letters proceeds in either a forward (vector=+1) direction from the beginning (front)
			or in a backward (vector=-1) direction from the end (back) of the word.

	Fail		The spelling match fails when a maximum reasonable score is exceeded
			or two "roadblocks" occur, one in a forward direction and one in a backward direction.

	Orphan	During comparison one name may run out of letters before the other name.
			If more than one letter remains, and those letters are bounded by at least one spcee,
			then the remainder is an "orphan".
			Example:	Comparing "Lake Hubbard" and "Lake Ray Hubbard" results in the orphan "Ray".
					The orphan is discovered via forward and backward scanning (vector = +1 and -1).
